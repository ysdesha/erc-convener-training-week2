# 🎮 Two-Player Ping Pong Game – Fun Weekend Project

Build a **two-player Ping Pong game** using an **Arduino Uno** and a **128x64 OLED display** via **I2C communication**! This project is not only fun and interactive but also an excellent way to learn how microcontrollers communicate with peripherals in real-world applications.

## 🚀 What You’ll Build

A fast-paced 2-player game where:

- Each player controls a paddle with **push buttons**
- The **ball bounces**, scores are tracked, and the game runs entirely on the **Arduino**
- All action is displayed live on an **SSD1306 OLED**

---

## 💡 Why This Project is Special

This isn’t just about playing—it’s about learning:

- Understand how real-world devices (like displays and sensors) **talk to microcontrollers** using **I2C**
- See how **digital input** (from buttons) can control live game logic
- Experience how code and hardware **work together** in real-time

---

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

- **OLED Display via I2C** (only 2 pins: SDA & SCL)
- **4 Tactile Switches** (2 per player for UP/DOWN control)
- **Buzzer feedback** for scoring and countdowns
- Clean game logic for:
  - Ball movement
  - Collision detection
  - Scoring
  - Countdown resets

---

## 💰 Budget & Build

- **Total cost**: ₹600–700
- **No soldering required**
- **Breadboard-friendly**
- Minimal wiring – perfect for classrooms or workshops
- Ideal for **live demos** or **group play**

---

## 👨‍🎓 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this project, participants will:

- 📘 Understand **I2C communication** and OLED interfacing
- 🕹️ Handle **real-time inputs** and update display graphics
- 🛠️ Build and play a full working game
- 🤖 Apply core **embedded systems concepts** in a fun, creative way

---

## ✅ Requirements

- Arduino Uno
- SSD1306 128x64 OLED (I2C)
- 4x Tactile Push Buttons
- 1x Buzzer
- Breadboard + Jumper wires
- Basic C++ knowledge (Arduino IDE)
